# Fork

<p> Keywords : Concurrency, Unix </p>

Concurrency : Concurrency means multiple computations are happening at the same time. In others word Concurrency is the OSâ€™s ability to execute multiple instructions simultaneously. Fork() enables this concurrency.

Unix : Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix.
Fork() is how we create new processes in Unix. When we call fork, actually we create a copy of our own process with its own address space.

Multiple tasks can be handled independently using the fork's working process, which is similar to the multiverse notion. 

Essentially, fork duplicates the currently running process, which is referred to as the parent process and the child process. And both processes will independently run the script from the first line to the last.


code example : 

```python

import os

print("Process - 01")

```
Here we got the one output.

if we use fork() :

```python

import os 
whatever = os.fork()
print("Process - 01")

```

And here we got the exact same output but two times!
